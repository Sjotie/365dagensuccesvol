# Context

Setting up 365 Hub - an AI-driven community platform for offline connections. This is a multi-agent system built with TwoFeetUp BaseCamp framework featuring 7 specialized agents (Planner, Retriever, Composer, Matchmaker, Health & Safety, Experimenter, Navigator).

The project uses:
- **Backend:** PocketBase + Python/FastAPI + Pydantic AI
- **Frontend:** Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind (submodule)
- **Deployment:** Railway (Docker)
- **LLM logging:** Logfire

# Today (2025-10-15)

## Setup Completed

### Repository Setup
- Cloned Dashboard-template repository into project root
- Removed old git history
- Initialized new Git repository

### MCP Servers Installed
- **Playwright** (project-specific) - Browser automation for frontend testing
- **Context7** (global user scope) - Automatic documentation lookup

### Core Files Created/Updated
- ✅ AGENTS.md - AI agent instructions (already existed, verified)
- ✅ .claude/CLAUDE.md - Identical copy for Claude Code
- ✅ README.md - Updated with 365 Hub specifics and 7 AI agents

### Pre-commit Hook (Mandatory)
- ✅ Installed pre-commit hook at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- ✅ Made executable with `chmod +x`
- Enforces TwoFeetUp documentation standards
- Verifies AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md parity (byte-for-byte)

### Documentation Structure
- ✅ Created `/docs/work/prd/` for Product Requirements
- ✅ Created `/docs/work/plan/` for Implementation Plans
- ✅ Created `/docs/work/progress/` for Daily Progress (this file!)
- ✅ Created `/docs/adr/` for Architecture Decision Records
- ✅ Added .gitkeep files to track empty directories

### Configuration Verified
- ✅ railway.json - Correct configuration with health check at `/health`
- ✅ Dockerfile path set correctly
- ✅ Deploy settings configured (1 replica, ON_FAILURE restart policy)

## Standards Applied

Following TwoFeetUp Development Standards v1.2.0:
- PocketBase as default database (not PostgreSQL/Supabase)
- Bun-first for frontend tooling
- Ruff + Mypy for Python linting
- ESLint + Prettier for TypeScript/JavaScript
- Logfire for LLM logging
- TDD encouraged with golden tests
- No silent fallbacks - surface errors explicitly

## TwoFeetBase References

- File ID `yh8vstyw8m69tsq` - TwoFeetUp Development Standards v1.2.0
- File ID `1n9ybi9rb2kszlp` - Agent Documentation Standard
- Pre-commit hook documentation successfully retrieved and implemented

# Next Steps

1. **Test pre-commit hook** - Verify it's working correctly
2. **Review PLAN.md** - Understand AI implementation strategy in detail
3. **Install Python dependencies** - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Set up PocketBase** - Run collection creation scripts
5. **Configure environment** - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add credentials
6. **Review existing agents** - Understand current implementations:
   - event_planner
   - event_contract_assistant
   - contract_clearance
   - marketing_communicatie
7. **Map agents to 7 roles** - Ensure coverage of Planner, Retriever, Composer, Matchmaker, Health & Safety, Experimenter, Navigator
8. **Set up frontend** - Initialize Next.js frontend from submodule
9. **Run development servers** - Test backend and frontend locally
10. **Create initial commit** - Commit all setup changes

# Notes

- **Context7 auto-invoke** is already configured in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
- Pre-commit hook is **mandatory** per TwoFeetBase standards - successfully installed
- All core files follow TwoFeetUp naming and structure conventions
- Ready for development to begin

# Blockers

None - setup is complete and ready for next phase.
