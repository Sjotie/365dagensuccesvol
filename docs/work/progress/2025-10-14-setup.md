# Context
Updating existing multi-agent project to full TwoFeetUp standards compliance. Project already has foundational structure with Pydantic AI agents, PocketBase backend, and Next.js frontend.

# Vandaag

## Completed
- ✅ Git repository verified (already initialized)
- ✅ Retrieved TwoFeetUp standards from TwoFeetBase
- ✅ Pre-commit hook installed and configured
  - Enforces documentation location standards
  - Validates AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md parity (blocking)
  - Provides friendly reminders for misplaced docs
- ✅ Documentation structure created:
  - `/docs/work/prd/` - Product Requirements
  - `/docs/work/plan/` - Implementation Plans
  - `/docs/work/progress/` - Daily Progress Logs
  - `/docs/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
- ✅ Golden tests directory created: `/tests/golden/`

## Completed Today
- ✅ Created AGENTS.md with full TwoFeetUp template
- ✅ Created CLAUDE.md (root and .claude/) - all three files are identical
- ✅ Preserved existing project-specific guidelines in new templates
- ✅ Created railway.json for Railway deployment configuration

# Volgende Stappen

## Immediate
1. Create AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md (must be identical)
2. Update README.md with proper structure
3. Create railway.json for Railway deployment
4. Document any deviations from TwoFeetUp defaults in ADR

## Future
1. Set up Logfire for LLM observability
2. Add golden tests for agent behaviors
3. Configure Ruff + Mypy for Python linting
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with AGENTS.md parity check

# Notes

## MCP Servers Recommended
- **Context7** (global): Auto-fetch library documentation
- **Playwright** (project): Browser automation for frontend work

## Tech Stack Confirmed
- **Backend**: Pydantic AI + FastAPI
- **Database**: PocketBase (scripts present)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (submodule at `nextjs-frontend-template/`)
- **Deployment**: Railway (to be configured)
- **Testing**: pytest + golden tests

## Deviations to Document
- Using PostgreSQL references in README but PocketBase scripts present (needs clarification in ADR)
